AWS IAM:- Identity And Access Management
	 It allows you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely.
	 IAM enables you to control who can do what in your AWS environment.

  Here are some key concepts related to IAM in AWS:

	* Users: Represent individual AWS accounts. Each user has unique security credentials.
	* Groups: A collection of IAM users. Policies are attached to groups to grant permissions.
	* Roles: Similar to users but are not associated with a specific person. Roles are often assumed by users, applications, or AWS services.
	* Policies: Documents that define permissions. They can be attached to users, groups, or roles.
	* Permissions: The rules that define what actions are allowed or denied on AWS resources.
	* Access Key: Consists of an access key ID and a secret access key. Used for programmatic access to AWS.
