CLOUD WATCH:-
   CoudWatch : as name suggest like a service is watching activities which are doing in cloud platform(AWS).
     Cloudwatch is like gatekeeper which will help in monitoring, reporting, alerting and logging.


  Fundamentals:-
	* Monitoring
	* Real life Metrics:-  ex:- To check the CPU utilization, To check the request made to applicaion in ec2 instances.
	* Alarms:- ex:-  Is to sending notifications if the cpu utilization is > 80%.
	* Custom metrics :- as default Cloudwatch tracks the CPU utilization as a metrics to our ec2 instance but not track memory utilization,
			to track memory utilization we have to enhance the metrics i.e, custom metrics
	* Cost optimization:- 
		* Resource monitoring:- Cloudwatch allows to monitor the aws services like ec2 instance. by understanding the resource utilization and performance merics,
					we can informed decisions about scaling up or down based on demand.
		* Auto Scaling:- Cloudwatch alarms  can trigger Auto Scaling actions based on defined thresholds. This allows you to automatically adjust the number of instances
					in an Auto Scaling group based on demand, optimizing costs by only running the necessary resources.
	* Scaling:-
	* logs:-  logs refer to records of events and activities generated by your applications, services, and AWS resources.
