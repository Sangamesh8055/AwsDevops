AWS STORAGE:-
	referes to the cloud storage services provided by AWS.
These services offer scalable, durable, and secure storage solutions for businesses and individuals,from simple file storage to complex data 
analytics and machine learning workloads

   Some AWS Storage Services:-
	1) Amazon Elastic Block Store  (Volume).
		ex: Hosting OS, Databases, Low Latency data access.
	2) Amazon Simple Storage Services (Bucket).
		ex: Social Media Images/Videos, Hosting static website.
	3) Amazon ELastic File System (File System).
		ex: Distibuted Computing.

		* Data is Stored into Unique Blocks.
		* Must be attached to EC2.
		* ex:- Unix ZFS, Ext4
	Use-Cases:-
		* Block level storage for instances- suitable for applications which are low latency, high performance

		* Shared File System = Hierarchical structure means one efs storage can  be used more than one instances.
		* Comes with serving File System using protocols like NFS, Smb.
		* Should be mounted on ec2 or on premises servers.
	Use-Cases:-
		* Shared File Storage for instances: Efs provides scalable and fully managed file system taht can be shared accross multiple instances.
