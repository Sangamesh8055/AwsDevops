ANSIBLE:- Configuration Management
	Ansible is an open-source automation tool that is used for configuration management,
	 application deployment, task automation, and orchestration. It simplifies the process of
	 managing and deploying software on multiple servers.
    
  Why Configuration Management(Ansible) :-
	In Cloud Platform, If we have created 100 EC2-Instances(50- Amazon-Linux, 30-Centos, 20-Ubuntu)
           If System Adminstrator or someone says to upgrade something for specific servers say to Ubuntu, rather than doing
	   manually for each instances we can do this by using Ansible(host) by configuring the remote servers(Ubuntu) using IP ADDRESS.

  * Ansible uses Python Programming language.

Purpose Of Ansible:-
	* Configuration Management.
	* Application Deployment.
	* Task Automation.

Advantages:-
	* Agentless.
	* Declarative Language.
	* Scalability.
	* Integration with other Tools.

Steps to Configure Targer-server from Ansible Server:-
* Create 2 or more Ec2-Instances(1 for Ansible, rest all for target)
* Install Ansible on Ansible server
* ssh-keygen - Click Enter 3 times,  (in this id_rsa, id_rsa.pub file created under (ls /home/ubuntu/.ssh/).
* id_rsa:- is private key used for login to machine(should not share to anyone).
* id_rsa.pub:- is publc key used for communicate with each machines.
* Copy the id_rsa.pub content
	* Open the Targeted Instance- and vi  /. ssh/authorized_keys
	* Paste the Copied id_rsa.pub file content.
* In Ansible server , ssh IpAddress of Targeted Instance. 

Example to run a simple or single task:-
ansible -m "shell" -a "ls"       if inventory file(/etc/ansible/hosts/) is in default location
ansible -i inventory(file_name) all(group_name) -m "shell" -a "ls"       if we created inventory file


Example to install NGINX:-
---
-  name: Install and Start nginx
   hosts: all
   become: root
   tasks:
     - name: Install Nginx
    // shell: apt install nginx  (or)
       apt:
         name: nginx
	 state: present
     - name: Start Nginx
    // shell: systemctl start nginx (or)
       service:
         name: nginx
         state: started
